## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Vanilla JS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned a good amount of new CSS tricks while working on this project. More importantly, I learned the hard way what a pain tech debt and poor planning can be. I think if I spent a few hours planning beforehand, this project would have taken half the time it did.

In addition, I learned that it's more important to work on making one thing perfect than trying to get a little of everything up at once. 


### Continued development

Going forward, I would like to focus on planning things out before diving into styling and coding. A technique I would like to employ for the next project will be to focus on one section at a time and not start something else until it is fully complete. I would also like to use React for one of these projects in the future, as I still only have a decent knowledge of the framework.
